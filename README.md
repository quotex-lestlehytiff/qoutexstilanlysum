## What are Candlestick Patterns?

Candlestick patterns are graphical representations of price movements
over a period of time. They are made up of a body and two shadows. The
body represents the difference between the open and close prices, while
the shadows represent the highest and lowest prices reached during the
period.

Candlestick patterns can be bullish or bearish. Bullish patterns
indicate that the price is likely to rise, while bearish patterns
indicate that the price is likely to fall.
